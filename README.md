## NURF Time Application

This is an entry into [Riot Games' API Challenge](https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/riot-games-api/show/bX8Z86bm)

This website will give summoners a place to check how champions measure up in 1v1's (No assists).
Using a sampling of the data provided through the Riot Games API for URF Mode, we'll give users
predictions on who wins HISTORICALLY, not necessarily every time.

We also plan to implement a teemo shrooms tracker for URF


The frontend and backend will be created with libraries and frameworks that are TBD.
