## NURF Time Application

This is an entry into [Riot Games' API Challenge](https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/riot-games-api/show/bX8Z86bm)

The goal of this app is to make a predictor for the game lengths of NURF mode matches.
NURF, being a "Gentleman's Thinking Game" ought to be a lot slower than a normal game, 
so players may want to get an estimation of how long they are going to be putting off 
other things.

Predictions will be made through statistical or machine learning analysis of data 
gathered from the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods).

The frontend and backend will be created with libraries and frameworks that are TBD.
